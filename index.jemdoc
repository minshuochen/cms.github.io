== About Me
I am an assistant professor with the IEMS department at Northwestern University. Prior to joining Northwestern, I am an associated research scholar with the ECE department at Princeton University, working with Prof. [https://ece.princeton.edu/people/mengdi-wang/ Mengdi Wang]. I obtained my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Prof. [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/ Tuo Zhao] and Prof. [https://wliao60.math.gatech.edu/ Wenjing Liao]. I also received a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, and Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Information Engineering from Zhejiang University. Here is my [CV_cms.pdf CV].

My research focuses on developing principled methodologies and theoretical foundations of learning and decision-making. I am particularly interested in
- Generative AI: diffusion models for data modeling and beyond
- Foundations of learning: approximation, optimization and efficiency 
- (Deep) reinforcement learning: diagnosis and control in complex systems

Feel free to send me an email if you have mutual interest with me.
